## Why we have used font: inherit ?

- To reset all the font sizes like h1,h2,h3
- As we should not see any font sizes as h1 to h6, we should use classes for styling them.

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font: inherit;
}
```

## Why we have used height: 100% in html,body?

- To avoid the double scrollbar.

  ```css
  html,
  body {
    height: 100%;
  }
  ```
